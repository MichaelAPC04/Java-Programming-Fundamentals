# Java-Programming-Fundamentals
*All assessments were completed individually in their entirety to time.*

## Assessment 1
This assessment was about utilising user input, arrays and good programming practices.

## Assessment 2
This assessment was about utilising arraylists, stringbuilders and invoking functions of other classes.

## Assessment 3
This assessment was about stimulating an AFL match between six user-inputted teams, simulating a total of twenty games played.

## Assessment 4
This assessment was about creating a restaurant takeaway and delivery system. The user inputs the food they want through the terminal, and when to deliver it. The user can also print their order (displaying its contents and price) and check the status of their delivery. This assessment utilises the concepts of abstract classes, inheritance, interfaces, enums, arraylists, stringbuilders, toString methods and the super method.
